# Smart Community Waste Management System

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to create an AI-powered waste management system that optimizes waste collection routes and schedules based on real-time data. By using sensors and machine learning algorithms, the system will help municipalities reduce operational costs and improve waste collection efficiency.

## Background

List of problems that idea can solve:
* Inefficient Waste Collection
* Environmental Concerns
* Inadequate Resource Allocation

Many cities struggle with inefficient waste management, leading to overflowing bins, missed pickups, and increased operational costs. Traditional waste collection methods often rely on fixed schedules that do not account for real-time fill levels.

According to the World Bank, cities generate over 2 billion tons of waste per year, with that number expected to increase. Efficient waste management is essential for maintaining public health and environmental sustainability.

With increasing urbanization and environmental concerns, I’m motivated to leverage AI to help cities become cleaner and more efficient. This project addresses public health, environmental issues, and city budget management, contributing to smarter, more sustainable urban living.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The solution will be used by municipal waste management departments to improve their collection efficiency. Smart bins will alert the system when they are nearing capacity, allowing for dynamic route adjustments.

For the type of users, city officials, waste management personnel, and potentially residents would benefit from cleaner streets and timely waste collection.

## Data sources and AI methods
The project will collect data from smart bins equipped with fill-level sensors, GPS data from collection trucks, and historical waste collection data from municipal records. Open datasets related to city demographics and waste generation patterns can also be used. Such datasets can be found [Article](https://data.world/datasets/waste)

Machine learning models will analyze fill-level data to predict optimal collection times and routes. Techniques such as regression analysis for predicting fill rates and clustering algorithms for optimizing routes will be employed.

## Challenges

The system may not solve issues related to illegal dumping or waste contamination. There may also be challenges in integrating data from various sources and ensuring real-time communication between bins and collection trucks.

Privacy concerns related to data collection and the management of sensitive information must be considered, especially if tracking user behavior is involved.

## What next?

The project could expand to include public feedback mechanisms, allowing residents to report issues with waste collection. Integrating AI to predict waste generation trends based on local events or seasons could further optimize operations.

Collaborating with environmental scientists, data analysts, and city planners would enhance the project’s effectiveness. Skills in IoT device integration and cloud computing could also be beneficial.
